        <h2>Initial Brainstorming Process</h2>

        <p class="h2-stuff">
            Initially we thought of something like a troll website that tries to trick you every step of the way when you try to log in to the website. However, we soon realized that that
            would be too generic, and we would copy too much code, thus scrapping it. We came up with other ideas like wordle, or spelling bee, etc. Eventually we settled into creating a website that keyed certain
            notes to be musical sounds.

        <h3>First steps</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="h3-stuff">We were searching up how to key a key on the keyboard to a sound, and well neglected pretty much everything else for the first day. We figured out how to do it and with 
            a few tweaks managed to create a functioning script that makes this possible, while also minimizing the amount of javascript used.

        <h4>Getting to the end</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="h4-stuff">We created the Homepage, though without its few mistakes, as well as creating a navigation bar to get here, Sources, and the point where you can access the music portion.
            We also managed to finish up the rest of the instruments that a drummer would use, such as cymbals, hihats, and bass. This is also the part where I, Alex, had a little fun.

        <h5>Adding the finishing touches</h5>
        <br>
        <p class="h5-stuff">We simply finished up the Thought Process, added Sources, added navigation bars for every single site that contains everything you need except well, 
          the ones that you need to use to get to this website.
