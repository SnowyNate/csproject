    <h1>Our Thought Process</h1>
    <div class="content-container">
      <h2>Initial Brainstorming Process</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Initially we thought of something like a troll website that tries to
          trick you every step of the way when you try to log in to the website.
          However, we soon realized that that would be too generic, and we would
          copy too much code, thus scrapping it. We came up with other ideas like
          Wordle, a spelling bee, etc. Eventually we settled into creating a
          website that allows the user to press certain keys to play musical sounds.

      <h2>First steps</h2>
      <div class="content reverse">
        <p>
          We were searching up how to key a key on the keyboard to a sound, and
          well neglected pretty much everything else for the first day. We figured
          out how to do it and with a few tweaks managed to create a functioning
          script that makes this possible, while also minimizing the amount of
          javascript used.

      <h2>Getting to the end</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          We created the Homepage, though without its few mistakes, as well as
          creating a navigation bar to get here, Sources, and the point where you
          can access the music portion. We also managed to finish up the rest of
          the instruments that a drummer would use, such as cymbals, hihats, and
          bass. This is also the part where I, Alex, had a little fun.

      <h2>Adding the finishing touches</h2>
      <div class="content reverse">
        <p>
          We simply finished up the Thought Process, added Sources, added
          navigation bars for every single site that contains everything you need
          except well, the ones that you need to use to get to this website.
